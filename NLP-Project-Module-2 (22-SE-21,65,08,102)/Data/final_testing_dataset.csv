Sad music doesn't numb the pain anymore, I can't find anything to make me feel okay for even a fleeting moment. I've eaten the bare minimum that is healthy because I feel like a useless fat and annoying person but I might just almost stop eating altogether. I might stop talking because it always feels like what I say either helps people manipulate me, is ignored, or makes things worse. I was to scream constantly but I can't.

I have friends, family, a partner, a job with some nice coworkers. But I feel no one really understands me, and at the end of the day, I am just doomed to essentially live life alone, while among people.

I spoke calmly about my struggles and my life and he listened for like half an hour. I honestly nearly cried he was so reassuring and spent so long with me even though I wasn't in desperate need. I came away feeling a lot better and promised to call next time i feel like cutting.

I went through about 6 days of torture. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't hold down food. I value life beyond everything but I had suicidal idealation. i struggled to even breath at moments
 
But here I am. 8 days later... 8 days and today I breath in sunshine. I laughed for the first time. I didn't feel caged. 
It only took 6days of extreme pain. And 2 more days To get to laughter. But it took 6 months to leave.

For courage. And comfort. I wanted to go back to him. I wanted what little he offered in exchange for 2 hrs of no pain.... You're comments helped me face the pain and not give in.

885,"My ex I dumped 2 weeks ago indeed was toxic, but also had some level of self-reflection and I do believe he genuinely loved me. Most of the time he was actually very loving and caring, it's the occassional controling, manipulation, jealousy and gaslighting coming from his own issues that made me feel extremely anxious, stressed and unhappy. Don't get me wrong I am super happy I finally got free, I have no doubts about the decision and I enjoy my peace. There is no way I would ever get back to this. But I am suffering a lot because I know how hurt he is, I don't think he will be able to get over it anytime soon and I know he is in a really bad state now. I really want to enjoy my freedom now and just be happy, but I can't stop feeling sad and generally upset over the fact that I hurt him. My brain understands but my emotions don't want to follow. What do you do to stop empathizing with them and start feeling the happiness you deserve?",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
886,"This was a whole back, but when I was 14/15 my grandma took me aside and told me, ""If you ever want to get birth control behind your dad's back, I'll help you.""

I kindly declined, but my sister later took up her advice, got pregnant, and my grandma was immediately using it as proof of why my dad shouldn't have raised us and that he's a crap father. 

I later find out that my mom, who passed when we were kids, wrote in her Will that my sister and I were to never be in my grandma's custody if my dad passed.

I’ve had tons of people claim that I need to have support systems and should put myself out there more to heal. Every person I’ve trusted when it came to supporting me left because people care until they realize I actually have trauma responses and show symptoms.

892,"They said people would argue with and bang each other during lockdown. They said COVID would trigger a boom in divorces and babies.

Well I has to be in the divorce category, didn’t I? Made more ironic by the fact that one of the triggering events for the divorce was because I wanted another child. 

Then there’s the sickening ‘COVID brought us closer together!’ Comments. The people who are just giving birth to their COVID babies. People buying houses for their growing families while I dismantle mine.

A few hours before, I looked around the Walmart with my wife.
A boy(maybe 19 or 20) came out from the console(PS4) section, saw me and started coughing with sound ""coronaknaknak"".
I was really annoyed but I ignored because I didn't want to make a trouble when my wife was there.

At this point I don't even have emotions or hobbies or desires or aspirations or anything, I just exist because I'm too much of a coward to end things.

There is nothing good about me. I am just a parasite, a burden on the people around me and on society. I am useless, talentless, stupid, ugly, selfish and many other things.

I don't even know what might have happened to cause my self-hatred. Of course, I think it is justified, but many people are as bad as me and do not hate themselves so it makes me wonder why the hatred is there.

Wednesday is my day off and it starts on tuesday nights, where he will keep talking about things he worries about or catastrophizes. We talk until he goes to bed. Then the next morning I wake up all mellow and do some chores, stuff for myself and then at lunch we sit together and he barfs all his work worries from the day onto me.. 

I just wanna chill out. I don’t wanna hear about all the little things that might go wrong or different than expected, who at work said what and why that’s rude, or how hard it is to get a hold of a psychologist. Just let me enjoy the snow, the sun and some home made lunch.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

Please ask a mental health professional these questIons. This community cannot diagnose you and frankly, it's disrespectful to ask. 

You wouldn't ask a cancer patient if they think you have cancer; you'd ask a doctor.  The same goes for any other medical issue: if you think you have it, ask a professional. Don't self-diagnose. Don't ask people who are already fighting it to diagnose you. We can help on the back end with coping suggestions and techniques, but we cannot help diagnose you, and it would be irresponsible to try.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
