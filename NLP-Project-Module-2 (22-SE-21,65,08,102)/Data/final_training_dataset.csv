When he was released she promptly moved him in with us. I found out that the only reason he was released is because she told the parole board that he could move in with us.

- 1/3 interviews with experts or personalities

Hi everyone,

I hope it's okay for me to post this here!  (reposting because I need more responses, hope nobody minds!) 

So I've been supporting my boyfriend with depression for some time now and I recently realised how his depression actually affects me and my well-being too.

Using my own experiences, I decided to research the effects of being a depressed person's partner for my master's dissertation.

I would like to ask you to consider taking part in my study. It will involve answering five questionnaires in total and should not take longer than 25-30 minutes to complete.

*You are eligible to participate if you:*

*-* *Are 18 or older*

*-* *Live with a partner or spouse who has been diagnosed with depression*

*-* *Are not depressed yourself*

For more information and to participate, go to [https://hull.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/effects-being-depressed-persons-partner](https://hull.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/effects-being-depressed-persons-partner)

At first in freshman year I thought that I needed to find a group to be a part of and felt like being lonely was a bad thing. 

But then my mental health went down the drain and for sophomore year I was sent to a residential facility in Provo Utah. I was there from August- early April. At that place I met a lot of cool people and it was the most friends I ever had. But after I got out, my loneliness came back because most of them live in LA and I live in the South Bay Area(six hour drive)

After that I kinda just accepted loneliness. Because it’s not worth messing yourself up just for friends in high school which you’ll probably never talk to again once high school finishes.

280,"Through the lenses of a 45M / No Kids (Thank thee Gods):

You go through a divorce, for a while (individual mileage will vary) you feel a sense of existential loss. You spend time rediscovering who you are, what your value system is, what makes you tick. You go through the throes of heartbreak, depression and angst. You deal with the waves of emotions the best you can. You work on yourself (In what whatever way works best for you) to reorientate yourself in the world, you reignite your passions and belief systems.

And then one day, it's like a switch just flips. You become happy again, you start living again. You no longer feel lost in the world. Truth be told, it does get better. Hang in there and live for you.

My girlfriend has been struggling with depression, when I met her she was just finished her therapy and got off SSRI's. She was such a happy, loving, fun girl. Now, 1.5 years later, she was just at the doctor's because of excessive suicidal ideation (kind of a crisis situation), it has been getting worse. I feel like she is here, but far away, loving, but distant; leaving me on seen all the time. Like this:

She is working very hard to fix this, I know that for sure, and I'm willing to take it for some (more) time.

869," They will project their feelings and blame you for how they feel. They do this because they don’t want to be responsible for their emotions, so they blame others for what is happening inside them. By doing this they set themselves up as victims, which allows them to play the role of hero.

 This makes them feel justified in doing whatever it takes to get back at you. Narcissists are masters of manipulation and control, they notice what buttons to push on other people to get what they want. The narcissist will say: “You made me feel this way”.

Narcissists ensure that you take responsibility for them, even though they are at fault. They will also accuse you of doing things that they have done. Narcissists will never admit they’ve done wrong because they only want to see things from their perspective.

The memories of one of the most beautiful women I’d ever met, which only cause me pain. Knowing I was too broken too even do that right. Then the thought of feeling like a child with no emotional stability or discipline creeps in. I can hold a dead neonate in my arms, but god forbid I’m alone, I’m without romance. I guess we all have burdens to carry. I’m not sure where I’m going with this, it just feels better to post than to force down",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

A heavy feeling that sits on your chest, constantly there with not even a moment for respite. It makes you feel lonely when you’re sad, will force you to laugh and smile while you’re miserable, and consumes your mind and life. It’ll make you want to harm yourself or even take that life. There’s seemingly so many “simple” answers and solutions to not being sad anymore, but they never work, at least not permanently. That’s the biggest problem when it comes to depression some would say, it’s a permanent problem with only very temporary solutions. In an attempt to not make this personal I’ve removed myself from this writing, but Id like to give an anecdote, I’ve personally tried almost everything I could think of.

I've been really struggling as of late, and having some dark thoughts and feeling really alone.

I finally made an appointment to get therapy for the first time in like two years? but I'm really scared to be honest. I'm worried that seeing a therapist will affect my job ( I work in a daycare) My spouse is worried that I may be put on medication, and they're not really a fan of that. I've felt so alone and disconnected from everything, especially my spouse.  I just want to get better, no matter what.

I either left on principle and had to pay alimony plus child support (due to the income disparity) or dealt with it. The former option would drastically affect my ability to support my kids and the later would drastically impact my mental stability. She wants to reconcile and I want to leave.

2238,"Depression is a void that eats at you slowly, something that creeps up on you the second you’re not distracted, a numbness, feelings don’t stick around no matter how enjoyable they are and the gaps between them feel immeasurable. It’s a constant regret of the past and dread of the coming. You want everyone and nothing you want to be happy and yet you also just want it to all go away and stay away, the worst part is when you still manage to function, you get up and eat and drink and work and chat… but at night, you feel that numbness, the craving for something other than this emptiness, slowly carving away from the inside out, too slow to notice by eye without a Timelapse… 

More people would realize they have depression and less people would misuse the word depression and less people would be harsh to depressed people because they view it as just being a little sad …

I've also recently started dating a girl who is an absolute saint, she has helped me massively with quitting drugs and alcohol and I can now proudly say I am 57 days sober! It has been hard and it may not seem like much, but I am trying hard to better myself. So yeah that's me...

I know it's my fault, really.

In my experience, when you're in your twentie, you can still muster up the courage to try to break the spell. I've seen it in other people. 
When you're in your thirties, your loneliness has brought along some habits thay make it difficult to escape it. 
For instance, wanting quietness in the house, having a hard  time changing your schedule, being afraid of people who show love interest for you know they've fallen for your  parade, mistrust of other people's intentions (as every extra person you'd allow, can shatter the last  hopes)

I am living in the UK and we are still in lockdown. No gyms, no clubs, restaurants and pubs. Every day seems the same and I feel bored and maybe a bit depressed too.

Every day I try to wake up early (I manage to do it), go for a hour walk, then breakfast/lunch. But it's difficult to keep the focus while I am so bored. How do you deal with the boredom?

I'm so lonely and depressed. I can't tell anyone at all. I can't burden the few friends I have with the heartache inside of me. I'm already a burden to them as it is. My life is so empty. I have no one to talk to. As a former foster kid I have been alone most my life. I'm so tired of being alone! Does this ever end!

I come home from a long days work and have no one to tell about my day whether good or bad. I have no one to run to when im sad and no one to tell my joys to.

Instead I smile, giggle, and am the main person all my friends or acquaintances come to when they need someone. I am a liar, I act happy but i am not. 

And yes, I got to therapy",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

God i hope im not alone in what im experiencing. Im completely rock bottom now

I swear this severe and constant depression has destroyed all my brain cells. God, i cant even begin to express how fucking moronic i am- ive zero common sense, absolutely no critical thinking skills. Im not joking, my mind is blank 100% of the time and i cant even reason or use critical thinking. Im just really dumb.

I struggle to grasp obvious jokes and sarcasm/satire goes over my head. Jesus, im just not thinking at all, i cant think whatsoever- my brain is super slow.... I LITERALLY DONT KNOW OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING; i am completely divorced from reality.

I cant even put forth a proper argument- ALL I HAVE EVER BEEN CAPABLE OF IS RECYCLING THE SAME ARGUMENTS LIKE A BROKEN RECORD- i literally canmot think, im a fucking vegetable.

My brain has deteriorated soo much that i dont know even basic shit; i cant do mental arithmetic anymore. I dont know what capitalism meams.... literally... absolutely nothing, no knowledge.

I JUST CANT THINK

I’m not usually the best at handling birthdays in general, I always get a little weird,but my boyfriend and I are currently at a weird place.

I’m just telling myself that It’s totally fine to have just a low-key birthday, and feel the feelings I have, but anyone with mental illness knows that’s not easy,and sometimes the feelings of sadness about things being different feel very intense.

This whole day spent in my pajamas, didn’t brush my teeth, didn’t do my laundry, grocery shop, cook, etc. When today was supposed to be the day i needed fulfill my responsibilities because i keep putting them off.

How difficult is it to deal with narcissists? Did you get illnesses from dealing with them? I’m going to share 10 Mental Illnesses you get from dealing with Narcissists.

A narcissist is someone who makes you feel less than human. They are self-centered individuals who always assume that they are superior to others. They are the master manipulator, and being around them is toxic and can lead to various traumas and mental illnesses.

Dealing with such individuals for an extended period may result in permanent trauma and psychological repercussions.

For context:

- I’m the type of person who sugarcoats everything, especially now.
- Most significant thing that happened during that time was a friend committing suicide.
- I’m a people pleaser. I don’t like bringing the energy down by talking about dark stuff, even prior to my friend’s death.
- I got ostracized from a friend group I held dear to my heart a year prior to friend’s tragic death, leaving me with little to no support system. It really made me wonder about the value of true friendship.

I wonder if subconsciously, not talking about stuff makes it hard to relate with me. I don’t finish movies, or tv shows anymore. I dont listen to any new music. I feel like I got stuck in 2018.

Management was notified and so was human recourses. The following week management did interviews to find out the story. As a result, the discriminating coworker was only suspended for 3 days. This incident has caused a hostile environment because many feel that management didn’t handle this effectively. 

The discriminating coworker also did a similar joke with me saying “blacks gotta sit over there”. I tried hard not to react how I wanted to.

For how I feel, I feel that management is trying to sweep it under the rug in hopes this will blow over. I’m stuck in a situation where I can’t trust management for anything. I’ve also struggled mentally at work recently and unsure of what I should do.

Hope your all going well. I posted a few months ago and hope that it can help you. I wanted to share that through a lot of grieving and processing I am pretty sure my ex was narcissistic. I think definitely covert through. I broke up with her back in December. 

My reasons are that:

1. She loved attention weather good or bad
2. Minimized my struggles 
3. Very controlling wanted me around her 24/7.
4. Tracked me on her phone 
5. Talked about getting married/kids very early on.
6. Lived in this fantasy of this great life we would have. 
7. Would cry Iike a little kid at any trouble in the relationship. 

This is just the basics but reading more about narcissism has helped me understand the trauma bonds I formed with her. As well as to why I felt so addicted to her post breakup.

About 4 months ago, I (35M) was suddenly dumped by my best (41F)riend  of nearly 4 years, and I have been trying very hard to find my footing again. Since I was dumped, I have been very social: I joined a ballroom dancing class, I do karate, I hike almost every weekend, and I go out to dinner with friends (people I hang out with but aren't that close with). But I still feel very lonely. I lost a deep, emotionally and intellectually satisfying friendship, and I crave to have that again. I've also never been on a date.

I am employed, but I don't make enough money to move out (and I would be very lonely living alone). I'm also in therapy because of said breakup.

I simply need a bit of love, cuddles and physical touch with no sexual intercourse involved. Is there a way I could simulate this for myself? Or how/where else could I get this? 

I miss human touch, and this has nothing to do with COVID.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
